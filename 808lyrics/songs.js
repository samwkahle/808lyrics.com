        "lyrics": "I think you are right undoubtedly that most people are accepting the war on terrorism but I believe that acceptance is very superficial, very thin, I believe it\u2019s based on the fact that people do not have information given to them by the media. Let me give one example. This should be played at high volume. \n\nKALW in San Francisco 91.7 FM, I\u2019m Laura Flanders and this is working assets radio, tomorrow in san Francisco people will have a rare opportunity to speak back to a federal body which wheels a great deal of power over who generally gets to speak to them. Federal communications commission regulates radio and tv, telephones and satellite transmissions and tomorrow at San Francisco city hall from 10-4 it will be holding a hearing to receive public comment on proposed changes to it\u2019s media ownership rules. With concentration of media in the hands of fewer, and fewer corporations isn\u2019t a new story but the changes in just the last 2 decades have been remarkable. In 1983, 90% of the major media were controlled by just 50 complanies, by 92 that number had been cunt in half to just 2 dozen companies and by 2000, an overwhelming majority of the mass media was only owned by only 6 companies. an overwhelmhing majority of the mass media was only owned by only 6 companies. 6 companies, 6,6,6 companies, 6 companies. Aol, time-warner, Disney, Bertelsmann, Fircom, news corporation and vivendi universal have already amassed holding across the media, from newspapers, to cable, to the internet.\nThe largest shift of ownership rules that the united states has ever seen, it\u2019s a dramatic review of every single one of our most important media ownership rules, a lot of people don\u2019t even know exist. But they control how many television stations a single owner can own, how many radio stations, whether newspapers can own television stations and how many. These are huge questions, because we\u2019ve seen for example in radio, where congress relaxed the rules in 1996 and it led to an unprecedented wave of consolidation in radio and now it\u2019s kind of hard to hear news. We\u2019re not hearing from the commercial stations, all of them are owned by one company, all of them are owned by one company. 666. We\u2019re not hearing from the commercial stations, all of them are owned by one company, clear channel communications, clear channel communications, clear channel communications, clear channel communications. I want to see more fairness in media. What you don\u2019t want is that so few owners in a community that they can dominate the dialogue and move it in whatever direction they might want to move it in without having the alternative of competing ideas to ensure that there are diverse owners of media. \n\nYou know the founders of this country figured out that there was only one way to have fairness in media. The way to get fairness in media is to make it possible for ordinary people to create media, and that means that it isn\u2019t in the hand of a handful of very large corporations. clear channel communications very large corporations. clear channel communications aol, time-warner, very large corporations, Disney, very large corporations, firecom, very large corporations, new corporation and vivendi universal. This should be played at very high volume. \nin the hand of a handful\nin the hand of a handful\nin the hand of a handful\na handful\n6 companies \nThat means that it isn\u2019t in the hand of a handful of very large corporations, but they are locally owned, locally produced, and related to the folks that are consuming it. That\u2019s the answer, and right now we have changes that will move us in exactly wrong direction being considerate and still the vast majority of Americans know nothing about it.\n\n\u00be of americans had absolutely no idea whatsoever \n\nPeople who did actually know about it, that small portion of the populace who knew about it was almost universally opposed.  \n\n\n\u00be of americans had absolutely no idea whatsoever \n\nPeople do not have information given to them by the media, \u00be of americans had absolutely no idea whatsoever \n\nWe have enormous freedom, that\u2019s not a gift that was given to us, it\u2019s a legacy that was left to us by centuries of struggle, by centuries of people, most of whose names are completely forgotten. Most of the ones who created the freedom and the rights that we now have and that will be taken away unless you constantly defend them. And there is in fact a major effort to take them away right now.\n",

        "lyrics": "If the Republicans want to pursue their domestic agenda, they\u2019re going to have to frighten people. The Republicans understood very well that they can\u2019t possibly win the elections if the issues are those that concern people, socio-economic issues basically, and the reason is they\u2019re cutting everybody\u2019s throat and they\u2019ll get smashed if that\u2019s the issue. They were able to stay in office by frightening people and that\u2019s what they did, it was necessary to frighten people into believing there is a threat to their security. In that case they\u2019ll rally around the strong leader, the brave cowboy, and they\u2019ll suppress their concerns over things like where\u2019s my job, or what\u2019s happening to my pension, or how am I gonna take care of my elderly mother, and so on and so forth. If they\u2019re voting on those issues the administration doesn\u2019t have a chance. People in the united states are genuinely frightened. \u201cEither you are with us or you are with the terrorists.\u201d \nAnd they did, starting in September there was a drum beat of propaganda about several things. First that Sadam Hussein is an imminent threat to our survival. Another was the constant insinuation that he was behind the September 11th attacks and that they were planning new ones. This was a spectacularly successful government media propaganda campaign, you can see it by looking at the polls by end of September and since, around 60% of the population believes that \nSadam Hussein is a imminent threat to us security and survival. By now over a majority think that Iraq was behind September 11th and is planning new things; that Iraqis were on the planes. If you go back before that it was 3% and the whole idea is totally outlandish. These attitudes are very highly correlated with support for war, and it\u2019s understandable, if I believed those things I\u2019d be in support for the war too. If you think that Sadam Hussein is an imminent threat to your existence, that he carried out the September 11th attacks, that he\u2019s powerful enough to carry out new ones, that\u2019s and argument for war. This is unique to the United States, no one else believes any of this. \n\n\u00be of americans had absolutely no idea whatsoever \n\nThe world is more concerned about the unbridled use of US power than it is about the threat posed by Sadam Hussein, which is an understatement because in fact the world was not concerned about the threat posed by Sadam Hussein because they didn\u2019t see any threat. Even his neighbors despise him but are not afraid of him. \n\nThe press understands that it is much better that citizens to not know about this. \nOne of the was they kept the country terrified throughout the 1980\u2019s was to conjure up an air base in Grenada, which the Russians were gonna use to bomb us. Fortunately, our brave cowboy leader saved us in the nick of time. Sent 6000 special forces who managed to overcome the resistance of a couple dozen Cuban military workers with pistols and and actually got 8000 medals of honor for it and we were standing tall after that if you remember. So we were saved, but for a while it looked like the Russians were gonna bomb us from Grenada, assuming they could find it on a map somewhere. Well suppose they found it. And they had bombers there, and the bombers in Grenada were doing just what we were told they were gonna do, everyone was supposed to be shivering, they were coming across the Caribbean to bomb Florida. Ok, if at that point the US sent out planes to shoot down the bombers before they destroyed us that would be legitimate under article 51 of the UN charter, that\u2019s preemptive war. This is something totally different, this is a doctrine that says we will attack anyone who we regard as a potential challenge. Nothing preemptive about that. Sometimes it\u2019s called preventive war but that\u2019s not right either, it\u2019s not preventing anything, the only thing it\u2019s preventing is a potential challenge that the US government invents or claims to be a challenge. So that\u2019s just an open license to go to war with anybody. Destroy anybody, which we can do because we have overwhelming power, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s understood. And that doesn\u2019t make people comfortable. It caused a wave of hatred and fear. This is the most feared and hated political leadership, maybe in history, it\u2019s hard to think of another.\n",

It\u2019s very thin, I believe it\u2019s based on the fact that people do not have information given to them by the media. Let me give you an example. \n\nToday we have a series on energy called the end of the age of oil. To understand why 9/11 happened and to understand why in mid-October 2002 the United States is on the brink of an imperial war of aggression against Iraq. One must understand the world is facing an energy crisis. A crisis based not on market or political forces. But on physical reality, the world is running out of the cheap oil and natural gas that powered the industrial revolution and the information age. \u201cThis is not about oil\u201d \u201cSome estimates indicate that Iraq could have as much as 220 billion barrels of oil that has not yet been discovered\u201d. \u201cThe US position, of course is going to be that this is not about oil.\u201d \u201cFreedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward. And freedom will be defended\u201d \u201cThis is about the war on terrorism\u201d. \u201cBut our responsibility to history is already clear. To answer these attacks and rid the world of evil.\u201d \u201cThis is not about oil, this is about the war on terrorism.\u201d \u201cI find the foreign policy of the bush administration exceedingly dangerous.\u201d \u201cEither you are with us or you are with the terrorists\u201d. \u201cThough the terrorist threat is real and we must defend against it. We are going about it the wrong way. What makes the situation so dangerous is that nobody dares to say something. The nation is in danger, therefore it\u2019s unpatriotic to criticize our leader, that is not what has made this country great. The strength of this country lies in the declaration of independence, the bill of rights, and freedom of speech and polls.\n",

        "lyrics": "Something like \"renacimiento es como yo vivo, yes\" which is think would translate into something in the neighbourhood of \"rebirth is how I live\"... the rest of the snippets are about dancing. I can hear \"bailo, bail\u00e9 in da ritma\", \"I dance, I danced in the rhythm\" and I can distinguish \"salsa\" and \"hiphop\". Also I can hear \"que tener limites\", \"entrenando de puntas\" both of which I can't translate but the first must have something to do with boundaries, and I think I hear \"dime si tu m'extrenas\" which would mean, \"tell me if you miss me\". That's all I can make of it :S I think there might be some slang in it aswell. ",
